    "## Summary of Changes Made:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Augmentation (Swap Trick)\n",
    "- Created `df_swapped` by swapping response_a and response_b\n",
    "- Flipped labels accordingly (A wins ↔ B wins, Tie stays same)\n",
    "- Combined original + swapped = 2x training data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Better XGBoost Features\n",
    "- **Punctuation counts**: exclamation marks, question marks, colons\n",
    "- **URL detection**: `has_url_a/b`, `url_count_a/b`\n",
    "- **LaTeX/Math detection**: `has_latex_a/b`, `latex_count_a/b`\n",
    "- **Capitalization ratio**: `cap_ratio_a/b/diff`\n",
    "- **Code block detection**: `has_code_a/b`, `code_blocks_a/b`\n",
    "- **Structure features**: `sentence_count_a/b`, `newline_a/b`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Upgraded DeBERTa\n",
    "- Changed from `deberta-v3-small` to `deberta-v3-base`\n",
    "- Reduced `per_device_train_batch_size` from 4 to 2\n",
    "- Increased `gradient_accumulation_steps` from 4 to 8\n",
    "- Added warmup and cosine learning rate schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Submission Pipeline\n",
    "- Complete pipeline for processing test.csv\n",
    "- Uses optimal blend weights found during validation\n",
    "- Outputs properly formatted submission.csv"
